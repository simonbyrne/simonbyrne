### Hi, I'm Simon

Here are some repositories to which I've made significant contributions

- [JuliaLang/julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/): [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). I've been a contributor since 2012, most of my contributions tend to focus on numerical and floating point aspects.
- [JuliaGPU/NVTX.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/NVTX.jl): Julia interface for Nvidia's NVTX instrumentation library, for use with Nsight Systems profiler.
- [JuliaParallel/MPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl): Julia interface for the [Message Passing Interface (MPI)](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) for distributed parallel computing.
- [JuliaIO/HDF5.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/HDF5.jl): Julia interface for reading and writing HDF5 files. I've been helping to refactor and add features such as MPI and virtual dataset support.
- [JuliaInterop/RCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl): for calling [R](https://www.r-project.org/) from Julia
- [JuliaInterop/MathLink.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/MathLink.jl): for calling [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)/[Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/) from Julia
- [JuliaLinearAlgebra/GenericLinearAlgebra.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/GenericLinearAlgebra.jl): linear algebra on generic numeric types. I implemented the [singular value decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) which works with both high-precision types (e.g. `BigFloat`s), and even non-real types like quaternions.
- [JuliaComputing/Miletus.jl](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/Miletus.jl): a financial contract modeling language and pricing engine. Can be used to express complicated financial contracts, and compute their prices computed via exact analytic, Monte Carlo, or lattice-based (binomial tree) methods.
